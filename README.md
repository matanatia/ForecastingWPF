# ForecastingWPF
Information forecasting for Twitters hashtags.The informtion i used in this project is currently local - its found in the signal file inside the bin folder, so no current information is being taken from Twitter will the app is running (this is the next step for this project) . The prediction is based on an example taken in 2016. In order to accurately predict, a learning algorithm was used using the WEKA API. The project was written in WPF # C as part of the final project in my degree.
